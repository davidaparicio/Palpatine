## Initial Setup.

WARNING ! BE SURE GRUB IS ON THE RIGHT /dev/sdX AND NOT ON USB KEY !!!

First step, during setup of Ubuntu Server LTS 14.04.3 be sure to be connected to internet by ethernet cable !!

### Initial Software

   * Basic Ubuntu Server
   * OpenSSH Server
   * Xubuntu

### Initial Config

   * Through XFCE : connect through home wifi (in case of ethernet issue)
   * First update and upgrade system

```bash
   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade 
```

   * Set a root passwd different from user password

```bash
   $ sudo su
   [Enter user password]
   # password
   [Enter New Root password]
   # exit
```

  * Change sudo config to ask for root password instead of user password when calling sudo

```bash
   $ sudo sed -i.bak -e "\$aDefaults rootpw" /etc/sudoers
```

  * Add ppa for awesome 3.5 for ubuntu 14.04

```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:klaus-vormweg/awesome
    sudo apt-get update
```

    * Setup initial usefull package : 
	   * vim 
	   * git
	   * mr
       * vcsh
	   * zsh 
	   * keychain
       * xclip
       * awesome
       * terminator
       * pcmanfm
       
```bash
   $ sudo apt-get install vim git mr vcsh zsh keychain xclip awesome awesome-extra
```

  * As I will use the terminal a lot, let's have our dotfile

### Get dotfiles

  As my dotfiles are manage with vcsh and myrepos, i'll gonna use my way to do it.
  Do as you use to

  * First generate SSH key for $USER (you) 

```bash
   $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   # Create a new ssh key
   > Enter file in chich to save the key (/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa : [Press Enter]
   > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase) : [Type a passphrase]
   > Enter same passphrase again : [Type passphrase again]
   > Your identification has been save in /home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.
   > Your publi key has been save in /home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   > ..
```

 * Add key to ssh-agent
   
```bash
   $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

 * Add your ssh key to ssh-agent
 
```bash
   $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

  * Add your ssh key to your account (github, gitlab, bitbucket...)

```bash
   $ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   $  cat 
```

  * Get your dotfile 

```bash
   vcsh clone git@bitbucket.org:vcsh/mr.git 
   vcsh mr remote rename origin bitbucket.vcsh
   mr up
```

  * Change your shell

```bash
   chsh -s /bin/sh 
```
