# Palpatine Setup 

This repo aim is to create set of script to easily (re)install lots of thing.

Among it, it will allow to do some setup that are useful after a fresh 
install of linux, such as : 

   * Configuring locale, timezone, keyboard...
   * Select a set of package to install
   * Manage user (add, update, delete).

Moreover, and the most important, this script will allow to easily setup a
server more or less complex to be self-host.

Each step will be briefly described here when they will be ready. A more 
precise description will be link or is accessible in each subfolder.

This will be mainly oriented toward a debian based system (such as Debian,
K.X.L.Ubuntu ...) and ArchLinux because it's the two main system I use.

Feel free to fork, update, contribute.

WARNING : I'm not responsible if damage is done to your filesystem. Theses 
scripts might not always work properly.

I'll try to list each system on which it will be tested.
