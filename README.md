# Palpatine Setup 

This repo aim is to create set of script to easily (re)install lots of thing and is oriented to help self-hosting using Yunohost and/or docker.

Among it, it will allow to do some setup that are useful after a fresh 
install of linux, such as : 

   * Configuring locale, timezone, keyboard...
   * Select a set of package to install
   * Manage user (add, update, delete).
   * Install and do some minimal management of Yunohost

Feel free to fork, update, contribute.

WARNING : I'm not responsible if damage is done to your filesystem. Theses 
scripts might not always work properly.

I'll try to list each system on which it will be tested.
