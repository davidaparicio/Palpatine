# Palpatine Setup

This repo aim is to create set of script to easily (re)install lots of thing and is oriented to help self-hosting using Yunohost and/or docker.

Actually working :

   * Configuring locale, timezone, keyboard...
   * Select a set of package to install
   * Manage user (add, update, delete).
   * Install and do some minimal management of Yunohost

Feel free to fork, update, contribute.

WARNING : I'm not responsible if damage is done to your filesystem. Theses
scripts might not always work properly.
